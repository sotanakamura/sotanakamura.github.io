# NAKAMURA Sota's Homepage

Welcome to NAKAMURA Sota's Homepage! I'm a graduate student at Shizuoka University in Japan. I'm working in a research on robotics and human intelligence.

## Biography
### A brief

I'm a graduate student at Shizuoka University in Japan, studying mechanical engineering and robotics. I've earned Bachelor of Science in Engineering in 2022 at Shizuoka University. My current research is porting neuroscientific knowledges into robotics to create more flexible intelligence for a robot.

My personal research is to create a micromouse. The micromouse is a small robot which solves a maze. I provide a small digital manufacturing space and rectures on how to design a line follower and a micromouse for other students.
